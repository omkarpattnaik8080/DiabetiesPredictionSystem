Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning and AWS Deployment<br>
This project aims to develop a diabetes prediction system utilizing machine learning techniques and deploying it on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The system predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on certain input features such as medical history, lifestyle, and demographic information.

8.Introduction
9.Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial in managing diabetes effectively. This project offers a predictive tool that can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of developing diabetes.

Features
1.Utilizes machine learning algorithms for diabetes prediction.
2.Allows users to input relevant personal and medical data for prediction.
3.Provides accurate predictions based on input features.
4.Scalable and deployable on AWS for wider accessibility.
5.Machine Learning Model
6.The system employs a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, family history, etc. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, where historical data with known outcomes are used to train the algorithm. Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting can be experimented with to determine the most accurate prediction model.

Deployment on AWS
-Deployment on AWS ensures accessibility and scalability of the prediction system. The deployment process involves:

1.Setting up an AWS EC2 instance for hosting the application.
2.Configuring security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
3.Installing necessary dependencies such as Python, Flask (or any other web framework), and required libraries.
4.Deploying the machine learning model along with the application code.
5.Configuring a domain name and SSL certificate for secure communication.
Usage
-To use the diabetes prediction system:

Input relevant personal and medical data into the provided interface.
-Submit the data for prediction.
-Receive the predicted likelihood of having diabetes based on the input features.
-Interpret the prediction and take necessary actions if needed.
